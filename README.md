# CISC325-Group22

Repository for Group 22's CISC325 High Fidelity Prototype

# Current Functionality:

Teacher Homepage

- Users can interact with menu buttons to navigate the site. Most of those pages don't exist yet, so expect some 404 errors.
- Individual projects can be selected from the table. For this prototype, they will all redirect to the same demo project.
- New projects can be added with the "New Project" button, updating the table instantly. However they will disappear upon page refresh because this prototype does not have backend database functionality.

# Planned Functionality:

Teacher Project Page

Student Homepage

Student Project Page

Login Page
